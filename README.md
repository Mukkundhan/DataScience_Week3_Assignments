## 1️⃣ Birth Date Validation and Age Calculator
This program prompts the user to enter their birth date in **MM/DD/YYYY** format. The input is validated to ensure it is a correct calendar date. Once validated, the program calculates the user’s current age in years and converts the date into **European format (DD/MM/YYYY)**. All invalid formats, incorrect dates, and unexpected inputs are handled gracefully using exception handling.

**Concepts Used:**
- Date and time manipulation
- Input validation
- Exception handling

## 2️⃣ Prime Number Generator within a Range
This program accepts two positive integers representing a numeric range and validates the inputs. It efficiently finds all prime numbers within the range using the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**, making it suitable for large input values. The output is formatted to display **10 prime numbers per line**, and clear error messages are shown for invalid input scenarios.

**Concepts Used:**
- Optimized algorithms
- Number theory
- Input validation
- Formatted output

## 3️⃣ Student Marks Processing and Grading System
This program reads student records from an input file containing registration numbers, exam marks, and coursework marks. It computes overall marks using predefined weightings, assigns grades based on grading rules, and stores the processed data in a **NumPy structured array**. The records are sorted by overall marks and written to an output file. Additionally, grade-wise statistics are displayed. The program includes robust handling for invalid records, missing files, and data errors.

**Concepts Used:**
- File input and output
- NumPy structured arrays
- Sorting and statistics
- Error handling

## 4️⃣ Weather Data Fetching and Analysis using OpenWeatherMap API
This program integrates with the **OpenWeatherMap API (Free Tier)** to fetch real-time weather data for a specified city. It analyzes temperature, humidity, and wind speed to generate meaningful insights such as weather classification (Cold, Mild, Hot) and alerts for extreme conditions. The results are logged into a CSV file with timestamps. The program gracefully handles invalid city names, API key issues, and network-related errors.

**Concepts Used:**
- REST API integration
- JSON data processing
- Data analysis
- CSV file handling
- Exception handling

## ✅ Conclusion
These four programs collectively demonstrate proficiency in Python programming, covering algorithmic efficiency, structured data processing, file management, and external API integration. The implementations emphasize clarity, robustness, and real-world applicability, making them suitable for academic assessment and practical use.
