#Python Assignment – Week 3 (Data Science / AI Internship)
 Overview
This repository contains my Week 3 Python Assignment completed as part of a Data Science / AI Internship. The assignment is designed to evaluate Python programming skills across multiple real‑world scenarios such as date handling, mathematical computation, file handling, data processing, and API integration.

Each exercise is implemented in a separate Python file, following clean coding practices, proper error handling, and detailed comments for clarity.

Exercise Details
🔹 Exercise 1: Age Calculator
Accepts birth date in mm/dd/yyyy format
Validates date input
Calculates current age
Converts date to European format (dd/mm/yyyy)
Handles invalid inputs gracefully
🔹 Exercise 2: Prime Number Generator
Accepts a range of positive integers
Finds all prime numbers in the range
Displays output in a formatted manner (10 numbers per line)
Includes proper input validation and error handling
🔹 Exercise 3: Student Marks Processor
Reads student data from a text file
Computes overall marks using weighted logic
Assigns grades based on rules
Uses NumPy structured arrays
Sorts students by overall marks
Writes processed results to an output file
Displays grade statistics
🔹 Exercise 4: Weather Data Fetcher & Analyzer
Uses OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real‑time weather data
Analyzes temperature, wind speed, and humidity
Generates weather condition summaries
Logs data into a CSV file
Implements API error handling and Unicode-safe file writing

Technologies Used:
Python 3
NumPy
Requests
CSV & File Handling
OpenWeatherMap API

Conclusion
This assignment helped me strengthen my Python fundamentals and gain hands‑on experience with real‑world data handling and API integration. It has enhanced my confidence in building robust and maintainable Python applications for Data Science and AI workflows.
